# Win32 Window

## CMake
While it may seem unitiutive to use CMake for a DirectX12 application given that it is exclusive to Windows. It becomes useful if I want to expand the project to other OS by supporting other Graphics API.




```c++ {numberLines}
#include <iostream>
int main{
    std::cout<<"Hello, World.";
}
```
